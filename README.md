# Simon-Says-Game

The Simon Says Game is a memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to test and improve a playerâ€™s ability to recall sequences. The game starts with a random color flashing on the screen, and the player must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding button or pressing the assigned keyboard key (Red - W, Yellow - Q, Green - A, Purple - S). With each correct response, the sequence grows longer, making the game more challenging. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, displaying their score and allowing them to restart. The game features smooth flash animations, an intuitive interface, and the flexibility to play using both mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. This project is an excellent demonstration of JavaScript's event handling, DOM manipulation, and logic-building capabilities, making it an exciting and engaging experience for users. ðŸš€ðŸŽ®
